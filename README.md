**Introduction to Alarm Clock**

An **alarm clock** is a device designed to wake individuals at a specific time, helping them manage time and ensure punctuality. It typically produces a loud sound, referred to as an alarm, to grab attention. Traditional models use mechanical or electronic sounds, while modern versions offer digital displays, customizable sounds, and additional features like snooze buttons or smartphone integration. Though many now use smartphones for alarms, the core purpose of an alarm clock remains the same: to wake individuals reliably at their desired time.
